issue tracking system

An issue tracking system (also ITS, trouble ticket system, support ticket, request management or incident ticket system) 
is a computer software package that manages and maintains lists of issues.
Issue tracking systems are generally used in collaborative settings—especially in large or distributed collaborations—but
can also be employed by individuals as part of a time management or personal productivity regime. 
These systems often encompass resource allocation, time accounting, priority management, and oversight workflow in addition
to implementing a centralized issue registry.

In the institutional setting, issue tracking systems are commonly used in an organization's customer support call center to
create, update, and resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that organization's other employees.
A support ticket should include vital information for the account involved and the issue encountered. An issue tracking system
often also contains a knowledge base containing information on each customer, resolutions to common problems, and other such data.
