BizX 


What Is BizX?

Our purpose is to improve the lives and businesses of our members. 
At our core is a deep passion for local business, and a personal understanding of the experience of the business owner.
BizX is a community of thousands of local business owners who engage and leverage one another within the BizX network, 
and a tool called the BizX dollar, which enables them to buy from and sell to one another without spending cash.
The BizX team hosts this diverse network of over 5,000 businesses, and manages the BizX currency, but the engagement and 
transactions are fueled by the membership.  
At BizX, it’s all about the members.
BizX is totally free to join and to be a part of, and members only pay a small fee when they choose to transact with one another.  
Nearly all do – because the result is universally positive: New customers, and better cash flow.
